## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data from kaggle to better understand:

1. Which Seattle neighbourhoods are the earn the highest revenue?
2. Which accommodation size receives the highest number of bookings?
3. How well can we predict listing price?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://andrewsithole.medium.com/data-science-by-example-a-case-study-of-airbnb-seattle-ab4ee5d4aaaa).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
